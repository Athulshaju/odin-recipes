      Shawarma (/ʃəˈwɑːrmə/; Arabic: شاورما) is a Middle Eastern dish that
      originated in the Levant region of the Arab world during the Ottoman
      Empire,[1][2][3][4] consisting of meat that is cut into thin slices,
      stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slow-turning vertical spit.
      Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken,
      turkey, beef, or veal.[5][6][1] The surface of the rotisserie meat is
      routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served.[7][8]
      Shawarma is a popular street food throughout the Arab world and the
      Greater Middle
